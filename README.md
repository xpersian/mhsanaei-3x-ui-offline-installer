**3x-ui Offline Installer Builder** is a high-performance, resilient tool designed to build fully self-contained installation bundles for the 3x-ui panel, specifically for air-gapped and restricted network environments.

## 🚀 Introduction
This tool eliminates the need for internet access on target servers by pre-packaging everything—from system dependencies (.deb, .rpm, .apk) to the panel binaries and SSL certificates—into a single, executable shell script. 

### Key Hardening Features:
- **🧠 Smart Update Engine:** Detects existing installations and offers safe updates (preserving DB/users) or clean reinstalls.
- **🌐 Multi-Repo Discovery:** Intelligent scraping of multiple streams (BaseOS/AppStream) for RHEL-based resilience.
- **🔄 Network Persistence:** 3-tier retry mechanism for reliable bundling even on unstable connections.
- **🔒 Integrated SSL:** Automated self-signed certificate generation or custom certificate bundling.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Download
Get the latest pre-built binary for your operating system from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Fox-Fig/mhsanaei-3x-ui-offline-installer/releases).

### 2. Run the Builder
Execute the builder on a machine with internet access.

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x xui-offline-builder
./xui-offline-builder
```

**Windows:**
Double-click `xui-offline-builder-windows.exe` or run via PowerShell:
```powershell
.\xui-offline-builder-windows.exe
```

### 3. Deploy to Server
Transfer the generated bundle to your target server. The output will be a single `.sh` file (the name depends on the bundle name you chose during the wizard).
```bash
# Run on the target server (No internet required)
bash YOUR_BUNDLE_NAME.sh
```
